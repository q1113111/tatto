                        <li><strong>How Should I Prepare For My Tattoo Session?</strong>
                            <p> Make sure you are well rested, well hydrated, and have eaten recently. Aside
                                from that, take a shower, charge your phone or tablet up to full, and don’t
                                bring in your 50 closest friends (1-2 are fine).</p>

                        <li><strong>What Should I Wear For My Tattoo Session?</strong>
                            <p> It’s more important to be comfortable than to be fashionable. Looser is better
                                than tighter, and keep in mind you want to be able to cover up certain places
                                that might show, depending on where you're getting your tattoo.</p>

                        <li><strong>How Should I Plan For A Larger Tattoo?</strong>
                            <p>It’s more important to be comfortable than to be fashionable. Looser is better than
                                tighter, and keep in mind you want to be able to cover up certain places that might
                                show, depending on where you're getting your tattoo.</p>

                        <li><strong>How Should I Plan For A Larger Tattoo?</strong>
                            <p>
                                First thing, come talk to us. The best large pieces always BEGIN with a cohesive
                                plan, not just bits and pieces loosely tied together. We can do a sleeve or back
                                piece with existing work in place, but it will ALWAYS look better when you come in
                                with a plan and allow the same artist to help bring that plan to fruition for you.
                                Along those same lines, it’s going to take multiple session and cost you $1,000 or
                                more dollars to even come close to doing a sleeve. So plan ahead and save your money
                                so that you can tackle these large pieces as they are investments and commitments.

                        <li ><strong>What Is The Pain Level For A Tattoo?</strong>
                            <p>A tattoo is probably a 3/10. The best comparison would be to getting a scratch on a sunburn or to having someone draw on you with a ball-point pen on a sunburn. It doesn’t feel good, but it’s more of an intermittent irritation than a constant pain. Remember, a tattoo has more in common with an abrasion than it does with a hypodermic needle shot from the doctor.</p>

                        <li><strong>What Is The Pain Level For A Piercing?</strong>
                            <p>If tattoos are a 3/10 on a pain scale, piercings are probably 7-9/10. Piercings are far more painful than tattoos - but only for a very short period of time. This is why people pass out WAY more often with piercings than with tattoos.</p>

                        <li ><strong>How Long Does It Take To Heal After A Tattoo?</strong>
                            <p>The majority of your new tattoos healing process will be done within the first two weeks. However, the skin is still working to heal and rejuvenate and you need to plan on a 4-6 weeks for your skin to be back to its previous state.</p>
                        </li>




                        <li><strong>Why Do Tattoos Start To Itch While Healing?</strong>
                            <p>As the skin rejuvenates itself, usually about a week after the tattoo was done, the itch sets in. This is 100% normal. Good moisturizers will help immensely with this but DO NOT SCRATCH IT! If lotion isn’t helping, run it under cold water for a few moments and you should be itch free.</p>

                        <li ><strong>Why Do You Require Deposits?</strong>
                            <p>Often we will have hours of work in drawing and preparing for a tattoo before you sit down in our chair. Deposits help to ensure you make it to your appointment and that we haven’t done hours of work for nothing.</p>

                        <li><strong>What Is Your Shop Minimum For Tattoos?</strong>
                            <p>Our shop minimum is $75. You might not realize it, but we go through nearly the same amount of very expensive supplies to do a tattoo the size of a quarter as we do for a tattoo the size of a softball. Everything has to be sterilized, before and after.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong<strong>Should I Tip?</strong></strong>
                            <p>You should ALWAYS tip those who provide services for you. Whether it’s your barber/hairstylist, waiter, or the kids with a lemonade stand down the street, if they provide you a service you should tip them. This includes your tattoo artist.</p>

                        <li><strong>Why Don’t You Run Many Specials?</strong>
                            <p>We LOVE to give stuff away. It makes us feel good. In our first year we gave away 10% of our gross income to our community. We charge what we do because we are creating unique art that will last your entire life.</p>

                        <li><strong>What Is The Age Requirement?</strong>
                            <p>For tattoos, we can tattoo minors age 16+ with a parent present and the proper identification (birth certificate with both names as well as photo IDs for child and parent - these are required for anything we do on a minor). For piercings, we can only do earlobes for those under age 14 and my piercer will stop and not do the piercing if the child says no. Starting at age 14 we can pierce anything (besides nipples and genitals) with the above consent.</p>

                        <li><strong>Should I Walk In Or Book An Appointment?</strong>
                            <p>We always encourage people to book an appointment for tattoos of any size. First, this guarantees you will get in at a certain time without potentially waiting for hours. Second, it gives our artists the chance to draw your new tattoo so that it’s 100% unique to you. For smaller tattoos, if we have openings feel free to try to walk in.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>What Happens If I’m Late To My Appointment?</strong>
                            <p>Don’t be. Seriously, if you’re late to your appointment it will throw our schedule off for the day.</p>
                        </li>




                        <li><strong>What Happens If I No-show During My Appointment?</strong>
                            <p>We’ve only ever had two people do this and it’s a terrible idea. If you no-show we will keep your deposit. That means your tattoo, if you do get it, will cost you 150% of what it should have cost.</p>
